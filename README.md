Building an E-commerce Data Model using PostgreSQL

## Description


This project focuses on developing a robust e-commerce data analysis pipeline using PostgreSQL, Python, and Jupyter Notebook. It demonstrates the integration of database management, data manipulation, and analytical tools to provide a comprehensive framework for analyzing and visualizing e-commerce data efficiently.

## Technology used
1. Python
2. SQL

## Dataset Used
[Instacart Market Basket Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data)

The dataset for this competition is a relational set of files describing customers' orders over time. The goal of the competition is to predict which products will be in a user's next order. The dataset is anonymized and contains a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users. For each user, we provide between 4 and 100 of their orders, with the sequence of products purchased in each order. We also provide the week and hour of day the order was placed, and a relative measure of time between orders. For more information, see the blog post accompanying its public release.
